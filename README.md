MAUI.

- **Commit exactly what you mean**: tick whole files, or click the gutter to commit single lines.
- **See image changes**: before and after side by side, instead of *Binary file changed*.
- **Branches made easy**: switch, create, merge, squash, rebase, stash, and leave changes on the branch they belong to.
- **Merge requests and pull requests**: create them in the app, and see the open request and its CI status in the
  toolbar.
- **Any server**: GitLab (any instance, recognised automatically), GitHub, or a plain git server over HTTPS or SSH.
- **History**: browse commits and amend, revert, reset, cherry-pick or tag them.
- **Updates itself** on Windows, from this project's releases.
